# Test module

To test our configuration I created two test modules that we can connect our drive unit or control unit to. All integrated we can quickly check wiring and software for correct resonses.

## Driver module

We have some caterpillar drive modules with 12V motor and 9V motor with encoder. And we have the standard yellow gearbox motors with 2 or 4 wheels

## Controller unit

There are some Arduino Uno modules with a L298P motor control, Arduino Leonardo with motorshield, Arduino Uno with L293 shield and of course our Raspberry Pi 1 B+ and 3B. And esp8266 with 7.2 and 10.8 Volt.

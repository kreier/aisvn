# AISVN Robot Platform

Platform standards for robot builds at AISVN

## Robot platform

This defines the location for the 4 mount points M3 to connect the drive unit to the control unit

## Function drive()

A standardized software function that can be tailored to the used CPU and motor to be interchangeble if you switch bases or control units

## Remote interface

To control the robots we have a serial interface to receive signals from bluetooth or WiFi or even a cable controller that is interpredet by the control unit to drive the robot. Since there are many remote control apps available and even different bluetooth standards, we had to standardize the interface to work with this variety. And not all apps are available both on Android and iOS.

## History

Back in 2018 we started to build our first remote controlled robots during club time at the AISVN. With ASA we've come a long way after that.

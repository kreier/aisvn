# Lasercutter K40 in 315

We have a 40W CO laser in room 315 for cuts 31x34 cm size. Some helpful informations are collected here to help cutting pieces for our robotics projects.

## General use

Switch on the two power lines in the bottom (exhaust fan and lasercutter), the waterpump for cooling and the little air compressor to remove oxidation products from the cut site are conneted to the laser cutter. Just switch in on with the red button.

Connect the USB cable to your computer and start printing. If you loose connection, you can unplug your USB and reconnect to continue your cut. After the cut just switch it of.

Wear safety googles! I don't know yet how to adjust the side arm length to european sizes, though.

## Software

You need K40 Whisperer software [from the scorchworks](https://www.scorchworks.com/K40whisperer/k40whisperer.html) website. Install the software and the USB driver, connect, cut!

## Cardboard

For 1.5 mm cardboard use 30% intensity and a speed of 15 mm/s.

## Acryl 3mm

We found that 45% and 12 mm/s for 3mm acrylic with single pass. The recommendation for 1/4" (6mm) was 85% and 12 mm/s from the source (cs.cmu.edu) below.
